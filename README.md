## What is React?
React is the infamous JavaScript library created by Facebook. It is now spread across like wildfire and used by a majority of the companies across the globe. This calls for developers who are proficient in the technology and can develop great user interfaces. Thousands of companies are now making use of React full time for their development needs and this is creating a lot of vacancies and requirements. Of course with this comes tough interviews, hence I present to you this Top React Interview Questions and Answers.
##What is the meaning of Virtual DOM?
A virtual DOM is a simple JavaScript object that is the exact copy of the corresponding real DOM. It can be considered as a node tree that consists of elements, their attributes, and other properties. Using the render function in React, it creates a node tree and updates it based on the changes that occur in the data model. These changes are usually triggered by users or the actions caused by the system.
Next up on these Reactjs interview questions, you need to take a look at some of the important features that React offers.
What are some of the important features of React?
React has multiple features that are used for unique purposes. The important ones are as mentioned below:

React makes use of a single-direction data flow model.
It deals with complete server-side data processing and handling.
React uses Virtual DOM that has many advantages of its own.
## What is the meaning of JSX?
JSX is the abbreviation of JavaScript XML. It is a file that is used in React to bring out the essence of JavaScript to React and use it for its advantages.

It even includes bringing out HTML and the easy syntax of JavaScript. This ensures that the resulting HTML file will have high readability, thereby relatively increasing the performance of the application.

Consider the following example of a JSX:

render(){

return(

<div>

<h1> Hello Intellipaat learners!</h1>

</div>

);

}
## Can browsers read a JSX file?
No, browsers cannot read JSX files directly. It can only read the objects provided by JavaScript. Now, to make a browser read a JSX file, it has to be transformed to a JavaScript object using JSX transformers, and only then it can be fed into the browser for further use in the pipeline.

## Why is React widely used today?
React provides users with an ample number of advantages when building an application. Some of them are as follows:

1.With React, UI testing becomes very easy.
2.React can integrate with Angular and other frameworks easily.
3.The high readability index ensures easy understanding.
4.React can be used for both client-side and server-side requirements.
5.It boosts application performance and overall efficiency.
## Are there any disadvantages to using React?
There are some limitations when using React as mentioned below:

Writing code is complicated as it uses JSX and inline template formatting.
Beginners might find it tough to cope with its syntaxes and methods.
The library contains a huge repository of information, which might be overwhelming.
React is a simple library and not a complete framework hence calls for dependencies.
## Differentiate between Angular and React.
Comparison Factor	Angular	React
Created by	Google	Facebook
DOM	Real DOM	Virtual DOM
Render Support	Client-side	Server-side
Architecture	Full MVC support	Only the view aspect of MVC
Data Binding	Unidirectional binding	Two-way binding
## What is the meaning of the component-based architecture of React?
In React, components are foundations used to build user interfaces for applications. With the component-based system in place, all of the individual entities become completely reusable and independent of each other. This means that rendering the application is easy and not dependent on the other components of the UI.

## How does rendering work in React?
Rendering is an important aspect of React as every single component must be rendered. This is done using the render() function. Once the function is called, it returns an element that represents a DOM component.

It is also possible to render more than one HTML element at a time by enclosing the HTML tags and passing it through the render function.

## What are states in React?
States form to be one of the vital aspects of React. It is considered as a source of data or objects that control aspects such as component behavior and rendering. In React, states are used to easily create dynamic and interactive components.
